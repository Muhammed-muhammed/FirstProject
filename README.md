# Features :

- **Daily Quotes:** The app fetches a new quote from an external API every day.
- **Interactive:** Users can change the displayed quote by pressing a button.
- **Simple and Elegant Design:** The app is designed to be user-friendly with a clean and intuitive interface.
# Problems :
Before diving into the details of how the app works, let's understand the challenges that the DailyQuote app addresses.

- **Limited Access to Daily Quotes:** People often find it challenging to discover and read inspirational quotes regularly.
- **Need for Positive Content:** In a fast-paced world, there's a growing need for easily accessible and uplifting content.
- **User Engagement:** To keep users engaged, the app aims to provide a dynamic experience by changing the quote with a simple user interaction.

Now, let's explore how the **DailyQuote** app solves these problems.


# Solution:

### Technologies Used

The DailyQuote app leverages modern web technologies to provide a seamless and efficient user experience.

- **React Query:** The app utilizes React Query for efficient data fetching, caching, and state management. This ensures a smooth and responsive user interface.

- **Vite:** Vite is employed as the build tool for the app, enabling fast development and optimized runtime performance. Its ability to handle hot module replacement contributes to a more efficient development workflow.

- **Axios:** For fetching data from the external API, Axios is the chosen HTTP client. It simplifies the process of making asynchronous requests and handling responses, making it an ideal choice for fetching daily quotes.

- **CSS for Design:** The app's design is crafted using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to create an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interface. The use of CSS allows for customization and ensures a visually appealing presentation of daily quotes.

### Application Flow

+ **Initialization:**
   - The app initializes with a default daily quote fetched from the API.
   - React Query manages the state and caching of the quote data.

+ **User Interaction:**
   - Users can change the displayed quote by interacting with a button.
   - The app triggers a new request to the external API using Axios when the user requests a new quote.

+ **Data Handling:**
   - React Query efficiently manages the fetched data, handling loading, success, and error states seamlessly.
   - Cached data ensures that the app remains responsive even in low-connectivity scenarios.

+ **Runtime Optimization:**
   - Vite optimizes the app's runtime performance, making it fast and responsive.
   - Hot module replacement allows for quick updates during development.

### Code Organization

The project structure follows best practices, with organized components, styles, and utility functions. The modular architecture ensures maintainability and scalability as the app evolves.

By leveraging these technologies and tools, the DailyQuote app provides a robust solution for delivering daily inspiration to users in an efficient and visually appealing manner.

# Methodes :

+ at first in `APP.jsx` we should wrap our component to `QueryClientProvider` and pas them `QueryClient` as a key.

  >`<QueryClientProvider  client={queryClient}><HomePage**/></QueryClientProvider>`

+ then in `HomePage.jsx` Component we should use the Hooks like **UseQuery**.
so we have an `api` then we define an function by Using **Axios** to fetch data to pas them to **UseQuery** hooks 
  >`const  fetchQuotes  = (numQuotes) => > axios.get(` [**Api**](https://type.fit/api/quotes?amount=$10)`);`
+ after that we should set a unique key to **useQuery**  in first property 
  >`const { data } =  useQuery(['Quotes', 10], () =>  fetchQuotes(10));`


+ the next issue is handling the `button` to show next quote by fetched data so we should define an `function` to manage the `state` and increase the `index` of quotes `array`.
  >`const  handleButtonClick  = () => {`

  >`setCurrentIndex((index) => (index  +  1) % (data?.data.length  ||  1));`

  >`if ((currentIndex  +  1) % (data?.data.length  ||  1) ===  0) {`

  >`queryClient.invalidateQueries(['Quotes']);}};`

and finally we use `className` of **CSS** to achieve `user friendly` **UI**.

# Tests :

### Unit Testing

Unit tests are crucial to ensure the individual components of the DailyQuote app work as expected. The following are key areas to focus on when writing unit tests:

+ **React Components:**
   - Test that each React component renders without errors.
   - Verify the behavior of components, especially the button interaction for changing quotes.

+ **Data Fetching:**
   - Write tests to ensure that data fetching using Axios and React Query functions correctly.
   - Check how the app handles loading, success, and error states during data fetching.

### Integration Testing

Integration tests evaluate how different parts of the application work together. Key integration testing scenarios include:

1. **Button Interaction:**
   - Test the interaction between the button and the quote-fetching functionality.
   - Verify that clicking the button triggers a new request to the external API and updates the displayed quote accordingly.

2. **Data Caching:**
   - Test whether React Query effectively caches data to improve app responsiveness.
   - Verify that the app retrieves data from the cache when the same quote is requested within a short timeframe.

### End-to-End Testing

End-to-end tests assess the overall functionality of the DailyQuote app from a user's perspective. Consider the following scenarios:

1. **User Interaction Flow:**
   - Simulate user interactions, such as clicking the button to change quotes.
   - Verify that the app responds correctly to user actions.

2. **Error Handling:**
   - Test how the app handles scenarios like network errors or API failures.
   - Ensure that error messages are displayed appropriately.
